  Run a program with program name and args specified by argv, in the
  environment specified by envp.

  The exec'ed program uses inpipe[READ_DESC] and outpipe[WRITE_DESC]
  as stdin and stdout, resp.

  You can safely leave outpipe and inpipe unspecified (0) if you
  want the command to read/write from/to stdin/stdout. envp could just
  be the environ extern that all C/C++ programs have access to, or it
  could be some filtered version of it. This function doesn't care
  what it is, but the cmd might (it might try to use $HOME for
  example). I don't know if it can a 0 pointer.
