The Java Advanced Imaging Libraries (JAI)
The Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools

The JAI and the JAI I/O Tools are standard extensions to Java created by SUN.  
They have versions specific to different platforms so we cannot distribute them
as part of the release.

You can obtain the latest versions of both of these from:
- http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/current.html

Detailed instructions can be found at:

ORACLE REQUIREMENTS
===================
In order to use the Oracle module, you need the Oracle JDBC driver
from Oracle. Unlike most external libraries used in GeoTools, we
cannot redistribute this jar.

However, you can obtain them from the Oracle website, free of charge,
after registering:

Please see the developers guide for more information.

management tool from the Apache group.  You can obtain a copy of maven from:
