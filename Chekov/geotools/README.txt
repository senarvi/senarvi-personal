REQUIREMENTS
============
To use the geotools libraries you will need:
Java 1.4.x or higher.
The Java Advanced Imaging Libraries (JAI)
The Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools

The JAI and the JAI I/O Tools are standard extensions to Java created by SUN.  
They have versions specific to different platforms so we cannot distribute them
as part of the release.

You can obtain the latest versions of both of these from:
- http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/current.html

Detailed instructions can be found at:
- http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/Dependencies

ORACLE REQUIREMENTS
===================
In order to use the Oracle module, you need the Oracle JDBC driver
from Oracle. Unlike most external libraries used in GeoTools, we
cannot redistribute this jar.

However, you can obtain them from the Oracle website, free of charge,
after registering:
- http://otn.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html
  
Please see the developers guide for more information.

BUILDING
========
In order to build GeoTools you will need a copy of Maven.  Maven is a project
management tool from the Apache group.  You can obtain a copy of maven from: 
- http://maven.apache.org/start/download.html

At the time of writing, the build process was known to work with the Maven 1.0
release.

Once you have maven installed, you can perform a full build by moving to the
