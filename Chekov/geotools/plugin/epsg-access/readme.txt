
GeoTools Plugin/Extention : 
    Connection to EPSG database in MS-Access format. This is the primary format
    released by EPSG, so it should be understood as the most "official" one.
    This plugin is very short and contains nothing else than connection parameters.
    Users wanting a connection to an other database (e.g. a PostgreSQL one) can
    look at this plugin and create a modified copy for their need.
  

To use this plugin/extention ensure that gt2-epsg-access.jar is on your classpath.
If this directory contains a lib folder then the jars it contains must also be included.
