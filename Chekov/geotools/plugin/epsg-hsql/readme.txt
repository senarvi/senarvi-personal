GeoTools Plugin/Extention : 
    Connection to an embedded EPSG database in HSQL format.
    This is database is built from the SQL scripts delivered by EPSG.
    This plugin is very short and the code contains nothing else than
    connection parameters through the use of a jar embedding the HSQL
    files.
  

To use this plugin/extention ensure that gt2-epsg-hsql.jar is on your classpath.
If this directory contains a lib folder then the jars it contains must also be included.
