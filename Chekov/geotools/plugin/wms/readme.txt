GeoTools Plugin/Extention : An OGC WebMapServer client implementation wrapped up in a GridCoverageExchange.
  
  There is a data model representing the GetCapabilities response mapped from the DTD
  to Java classes. This is in the wms.getCapabilities package.

To use this plugin/extention ensure that gt2-wms.jar is on your classpath.
If this directory contains a lib folder then the jars it contains must also be included.
