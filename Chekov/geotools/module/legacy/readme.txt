GeoTools Plugin/Extention : This module contains code which has been depricated.  It exists to help users whilst updating their code and to support the 'migrate' module which contains 
  core geotools code which needs to be updated before it can move back into main.
  

To use this plugin/extention ensure that gt2-legacy.jar is on your classpath.
If this directory contains a lib folder then the jars it contains must also be included.

Please report bugs and feature requests using http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10270.
