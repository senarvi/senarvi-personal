
GeoTools Plugin/Extention : This module contains code which depends on legacy methods or classes.  
  It is code which should find its way back into the main module once the dependancy on depricated code has been resolved.
  

To use this plugin/extention ensure that gt2-migrate.jar is on your classpath.
If this directory contains a lib folder then the jars it contains must also be included.

Please report bugs and feature requests using http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10270.
